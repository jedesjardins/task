# List of Todos:
* Remove usage of new and allow for a #define to set memory 
* Move StealQueues and MPSCQueues into their own helper library
* Disallow storing data that is larger than what can fit in the extra data so it doesn't implicitly store a pointer to it and dereference it
* Add Tests
* Add Examples
